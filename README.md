# Data-Mining-Project
given datasets of sell orders of the Digikala and Divar platforms, We have been tasked to do four things: 

### Phase1
The initial study of the dataset we have at hand

### Phase2
Finding Frequent patterns within our datasets (based on four different parts of the dataset which is stated in the project)

### Phase3
Performing clustering based on certain columns in our dataset (This too has four parts, stated in the project)

### Phase4
Building a classifier which predicts the price of items within the Divar dataset
